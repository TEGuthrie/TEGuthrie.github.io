            <ul>
                <li>What's the largest image you can engrave?
                    <ul>
                        <p>We have several different laser engravers.<br>
                            Our smallest engraver marks an area of approximately 170mm by 180mm (6.7" x 7"), and up to approximately 420 lines per inch. The trade-off with the high resolution is speed. Engraving at 420 lines per inch is slow.<br>
                            Our largest laser engraver can engrave an area of 380mm x 400mm (15" x 15.75"), and up to approximately 254 lines per inch. This is also our fastest laser engraver.<br>
                            Cutting is a relatively slow process, even on our large laser, and limited to materials approximately 10mm - 12mm thick (0.3" - 0.5").</p>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>What kinds of materials can you engrave?
                    <ul>
                        <p>We can engrave all kinds of organic materials. When we say organic we mean things like wood, slate, cork, and leather.<br>
                        We can also engrave anodized metal, like aluminum.
                        </p>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Can you cut with the lasers?
                    <ul>
                        <p>Yes. We can cut paper, cardboard, picture framing matboard, wood, cork, and leather.<br>
                            Cutting can be a slow process, sometimes requiring multiple slow passes.
                            The thicker and harder the material, the longer it takes to cut it.</p>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Can you engrave tumblers or cups, like a Yeti?
                    <ul>
                        <p>Yes and no.<br>
                            <b>Yes:</b> We can engrave tumblers and cups, like Yeti, RTIC, Stanley, etc., as long as they are painted or powder coated.<br>
                            <b>No:</b> We can not engrave shiny/polished/unpainted tumblers or cups because it requires a type of laser that we do not have.</p>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>What materials can not be engraved?
                    <ul>
                        <p>We can not engrave precious metals like gold, silver, platinum, or metals such as stainless steel, copper, brass, or bronze.<br>
                            We can not engrave glass, acrylic, or pmags.<br>
                            All of the above materials require a type of laser system that we do not have.</p>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>How long will it take to get my order?
                    <ul>
                        <p>It depends on how busy we are and how you are receiving your completed items.<br>
                            If we are shipping your completed items via USPS, UPS, FedEx, DHL, etc., that will depend on what service you have chosen, and how busy they are.<br>
                            We will ship your order as quickly as we can after we complete the work. In all cases we will let you know when we have shipped your order and provide a tracking number if one is available.</p>
